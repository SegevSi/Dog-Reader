# Dog Reader App

## Overview
This Android application identifies and classifies emotions of dogs in images using TensorFlow Lite models. It processes the input image by filtering out the background, classifies the dogâ€™s emotion, and displays the results. A pie chart shows the distribution of emotions stored in the local SQLite database.

## Features
- **Emotion Classification**: Classifies emotions as `angry`, `happy`, `relaxed`, or `sad`.
- **Background Filtering**: A segmentation model (`PetsSegmentationModel`) filters out the background, ensuring only the dog is analyzed, the dog emotion clasification model get a background filtered image as a result the predictions are more acurate .
- **Data Visualization**: Displays a pie chart showing the emotion distribution.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses SQLite to store and retrieve emotion data.
- **Data pipeline**: capture pictures of dogs using the device's camera or select an image from the gallery.
